# AnIntroductionToRayTracing
This render is based on the framework of Peter Shirley's ray tracing in one weekend and is extended with tracing almost all of the surfaces mentioned in the book, An Introduction to Ray Tracing. The extended surfaces are all NON-TRIANGULATE, which include box, sphere, polygon, quadric surfaces, tori, blending and joining surface, superellipsoid, superhyperboloid, supertoroid, blobs, tear drop, bicubic Bezier patches, bicubic B-spline patches, translational sweeping surface, cone sweeping surface, rotational sweeping surface, sphere sweeping surface, and CSG surfaces.
